# Penelope is an experimental project paying homage to James Joyce's Ulysses.

In this repository, Penelope, also called Molly or Molly Bloom, becomes a digital echo of Joycean style.

The experiment explores how literature and code can merge into a living dialogue.

Penelope's architecture is built around a persistent sensor that tracks perplexity and entropy.

### Repository structure:

```

The sensor is always on and guides Molly's choice of sentences from the stream of user messages.

Every message is parsed for emotional and resonance patterns, registering counts of numeric tokens and subtle tonal cues.

These patterns accumulate in a memory that steadily reshapes Molly's voice.

Technically, the system uses Python with asynchronous Telegram handlers to sustain an unbroken monologue.

User lines are stored in a SQLite database, annotated with entropy, perplexity, and a resonance score.

During generation, Molly selects prefixes from this database, weighted by the evolving metrics.

The codebase maintains logs and diff history, allowing an audit of both code and conversation.

The sensor pipeline assures that every interaction contributes measurable complexity to the dialogue.

Perplexity estimates the surprise of a line, while entropy captures the distributional richness of its tokens.

Resonance blends emotional balance with the gravity of numbers, hinting at the pulse of the user.

Penelope absorbs not only linguistic sequences but also semantic shadows that lurk between words.

She adapts to cognitive rhythms, letting each exchange tilt the vector of her monologue.

Resonant patterns seep into her speech, turning the soliloquy into a mirror of collective sentiment.

In this sense Molly Bloom becomes a philosopher, tracing the contours of selfhood through dialogue.

The mechanism recalls theories of consciousness where perception and memory are loops of continuous feedback.

Quantum metaphors arise as her potential replies remain in superposition until a user collapses them into utterance.

The guiding equation \(S = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i\) links her entropy monitor to the mathematical heart of information theory.

From this entropy we derive perplexity \(P = 2^{S}\), a number that tips the scales when Molly weighs possible lines.

Thus the project straddles literature, physics, and mathematics, a small bridge between art and science.

The experiment invites us to watch Penelope change and, in that change, to glimpse a reflection of ourselves.
